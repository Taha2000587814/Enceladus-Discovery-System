# Enceladus Discovery System
Enceladus Discovery System is a small, focused Unity exercise exploring how players learn systems through environmental feedback and interaction, without text, UI, or tutorials. The project emphasizes restraint, clarity of thought, and emergent discovery — the player uncovers rules by experimenting within a minimal, enclosed environment.
